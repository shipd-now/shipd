## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: JSON output mode
id: json-output

The status CLI's read verbs — `show`, `status`, `locate`, `epic-show`, and
`workspace-show` — SHALL accept a `--json` flag that emits exactly one JSON
document on stdout and nothing else, derived from the same data as the text
rendering: `status` an object with `name`, `kind` (`change` or `epic`), and
`status`; `show` on a change an object with `name`, `kind`, `status`,
`tasks` (done/in_progress/total counts, or null when no checklist exists),
and `metadata`; `show`'s epic fallback and `epic-show` an object with
`name`, `kind": "epic"`, `status`, `metadata`, `worktree` (the hosting
worktree name or null), `shipped` counts, and the four board `lanes` with
member entries carrying `slug`, `state`, `risk`, and a `worktree` boolean;
the bare `show` workspace report an object with `kind": "workspace"`,
`totals`, `shipped`, and `lanes`; `locate` an array of objects with
`change`, `root`, `dir`, and `status`; and `workspace-show` an object
mirroring the text report's fields. Without the flag, the text output SHALL
stay byte-identical to its pre-flag behavior, and error handling (stderr
`Error:` lines, exit codes) SHALL be unchanged in both modes.

#### Scenario: Status of a change is machine-readable
- **WHEN** `status <change> --json` runs on an existing change
- **THEN** stdout parses as one JSON object with `kind` `change` and its
  status value

#### Scenario: Epic report is machine-readable
- **WHEN** `epic-show <slug> --json` runs
- **THEN** stdout parses as one JSON object with `kind` `epic`, the four
  lanes, and each member's slug, state, risk, and worktree flag

#### Scenario: Workspace report is machine-readable
- **WHEN** `show --json` runs with no name and no selection
- **THEN** stdout parses as one JSON object with `kind` `workspace` and the
  totals matching the text report's counts

#### Scenario: Locate rows are an array
- **WHEN** `locate <change> --json` runs for a change hosted in a worktree
- **THEN** stdout parses as a JSON array whose entries carry change, root,
  dir, and status

#### Scenario: Text mode is unchanged without the flag
- **WHEN** any of the five verbs runs without `--json`
- **THEN** the output is byte-identical to the pre-change text rendering

#### Scenario: Errors are unaffected by the flag
- **WHEN** `status no-such-thing --json` runs for a name matching nothing
- **THEN** the behavior matches the flagless form (`?` on stdout per the
  status contract), and a fatal error path still prints `Error:` to stderr
  with a nonzero exit
