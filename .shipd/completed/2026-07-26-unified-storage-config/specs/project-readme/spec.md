## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: README documents the spec engine and status pipeline
id: readme-documents-spec-engine
base: c6f1d8f8db97

The `README.md` SHALL document the homegrown spec system: the `.shipd/` layout
(`planned/` in-flight changes, `completed/` applied changes, `verified/`
master library) with its configurability via `.shipd-config.json` (layered
upward search, the `dir` key) and the lean change artifacts; the five-status
lifecycle (`draft`, `ready`, `active`, `complete`, `verified`) with one-line
stage meanings, its pipeline ownership, and the guarded `set-status`
transitions with `--force` override; the ☕ statusline (rendered line
format, spec selection via `spec_status.py use`, and its
`.claude/settings.json` registration); and the build telemetry (report
table, the `build` config key in `~/.shipd-config.json`, `builds.jsonl` under
`~/.shipd/builds/`). It SHALL link to the content directory's `README.md` as
the grammar authority rather than restating the requirement/delta grammar.

#### Scenario: Lifecycle is explained
- **WHEN** a reader reaches the spec-engine documentation
- **THEN** the five statuses appear in pipeline order with a one-line
  meaning each, and guarded transitions with `--force` override are
  described

#### Scenario: Storage convention is explained
- **WHEN** a reader reaches the layout documentation
- **THEN** the `.shipd/` default, the `.shipd-config.json` layering, and the
  `dir` key are described
